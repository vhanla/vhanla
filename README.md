### Welcome
This is my GitHub's open source repository page, I write programs just to have fun, they are my hobbies, I try to make tools mainly for Windows using Object Pascal, C#, Assembly, Python, etc. and also web stuff.

Some of them are just proof of concepts, maybe they might remain as neverending WIP projects, or maybe some might get more attention and get continuous maintenance, as I said, they're hobby projects.

Thanks for reading. Take care.
